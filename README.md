# pygabor : Gabor transform toolbox for Python

Contains the following modules for performing time-frequency analysis on discrete signals:

## timecausgabor.py: Primitives for computing the time-causal analogue of the Gabor transform

The time-causal analogue of the Gabor transform is obtained by choosing the temporal window function in a time-frequency analysis as the time-causal limit kernel, which provides a theoretically well-founded way to define a time-frequency analysis over a time-causal temporal domain, for which the future cannot be accessed.

Notably, while the current code is written for offline experiments, the underlying approach is fully time-causal and time-recursive, and should therefore be highly suitable for real-time applications.

For examples of how to apply these functions for computing time-causal time-frequency transforms, please see the enclosed Jupyter notebook 
[timecausgabordemo.ipynb](https://github.com/tonylindeberg/pygabor/blob/main/timecausgabordemo.ipynb).

For more technical descriptions about the respective functions, please see
the documentation strings for the respective functions in the source code
in [timecausgabor.py](https://github.com/tonylindeberg/pygabor/blob/main/pygabor/timecausgabor.py).



## discgabor.py: Primitives for computing the discrete analogue of the Gabor transform

The discrete analogue of the Gabor transform is obtained by choosing the temporal window function in a time-frequency analysis as the discrete analogue of the Gaussain kernel, which provides a theoretically well-founded way to discretize the continuous Gaussian kernel in such a way that the underlying theoretical properties, that make the Gaussian kernel a canonical choice over a non-causal temporal domain, do also hold after the discretization

For reference purpose, this package also provides a possibility to choose the temporal window function as the sampled Gaussian kernel, which may otherwise constitute the most commonly used choice for discretizing the continuous Gaussian kernel

For examples of how to apply these functions for computing non-causal time-frequency transforms, please see the enclosed Jupyter notebook 
[discgabordemo.ipynb](https://github.com/tonylindeberg/pygabor/blob/main/discgabordemo.ipynb).

For more technical descriptions about the respective functions, please see
the documentation strings for the respective functions in the source code
in [discgabor.py](https://github.com/tonylindeberg/pygabor/blob/main/pygabor/discgabor.py).


## spectrogram.py: Functions for computing spectrograms based on the above time-frequency analysis methods

Computes combined spectrograms, by applying either the time-causal analogue of the Gabor transform or the discrete analogue of the Gabor transform over a set of logarithmically distributed frequencies.

The current focus of code is with regard to auditory spectrograms. With minor modifications, the approach is, however, also applicable to computing spectrograms for other application domains.

For examples of how to use these functions for computing different types of time-causal or non-causal spectrograms, please see the enclosed Jupyter notebook 
[spectrogramdemo.ipynb](https://github.com/tonylindeberg/pygabor/blob/main/spectrogramdemo.ipynb).
